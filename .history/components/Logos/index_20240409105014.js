        Sqwell's logo integrates our company mascot, Sqwee, seamlessly into our company name. The warm brown colour scheme corresponds with the hues of our squirrel mascot, imparting a cohesive visual identity. The font Nunito matches our body text and aligns with our brand identity. The design uses three layers of text, utilizing shadows and highlights, to create a three-dimensional effect. The Soft rounded edges add a touch of elegance and modernity.
