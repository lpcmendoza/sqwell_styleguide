        Sqwell's logo integrates our company mascot, Sqwee, seamlessly into our company name. The warm brown color scheme harmonizes with the hues of our squirrel mascot, imparting a cohesive visual identity. The design employs shadows and highlights to create a three-dimensional effect, while soft rounded edges add a touch of elegance and modernity.
