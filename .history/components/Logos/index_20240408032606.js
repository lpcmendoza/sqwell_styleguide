        Sqwellâ€™s logo encorporates our company mascot Sqwee and seamlessly blends into our company name. The colour scheme consists of warm browns that match the colour of our squirrel mascot. The design has a three-dimensional feel using shadows and highlights, with soft rounded edges for a sleeker feel.
